`MEGMotion.m` is a script that wraps around `MEG_mean_dist.m`


Find mean displacment across 103 sensor positions converted from device space to head space.

Sensors converted based on 'MaxFilter v2.1 Users Manual: Appendex D.2 Coordinate matching (pg 77)' and channels CHP001 to 006.

[latex]
$ y_j = Rx_j + T $

Displacement calculation from Wehner et al, 2008 as the mean norm temporal difference of each sensor.

[latex]
$ D(t) = \frac{1}{N} \sum^{N_s}_{k=1} \| r_h^{k}(t) - r_h^{k}(t_0) \| $

NOTE:  Should have named MEG_mean_disp instead of _dist.
